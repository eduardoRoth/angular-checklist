# Problem

Understanding complex and nested component trees can be challenging, especially if you are interested in the DOM view, the logic, and data layer. In addition, it's not easy to debug Angular components using standard debugging tools because they are not adapted very well for Angular-specific features.

# Solution

Angular DevTools (available in Chrome) is an extension to Chrome DevTools. It provides a set of helpful features to debug your Angular application.

You can:

- explore component or directive structure, check its current state or even edit it
- profile your application to check for performance bottlenecks, including change detection execution information
